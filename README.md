Efficient Nuclei Semantic Segmentation in Histopathology Images: A Weakly Supervised Approach with Color and Sure-Foreground Extraction
We used the Weakly supervised nuclei segmentation with point annotation masks. In that we proposed color region extraction method and sure-foreground extraction method. And we also proposed boundary-aware loss.
We used the CPM and CoNSeP datasets to evaluate our method.
We used the four evaluation metrics: IoU, F1 score, Dice_obj and AJI.
The implemented code will be appeared in a month.
